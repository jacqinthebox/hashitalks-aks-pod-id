# Running Vault on AKS with Pod Identity

This repository was developed for use with my HashiTalks presentation on February 20, 2020. The intention was to demonstrate using the AKS Pod Identity project with a HashiCorp Vault deployment running on Kubernetes. The Pod Identity project would be used to provide an MSI to the Vault pods for use with the Azure Auth setup. It would also be used to allow other pods in the cluster to authenticate to Vault and retrieve a value stored on Vault's k/v store.
